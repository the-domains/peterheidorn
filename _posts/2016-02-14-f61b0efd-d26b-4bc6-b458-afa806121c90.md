Hi, I'm Peter Heidorn.  I'm a Social Media Creative.  I manage brands.  I produce creative.  I build digital reflections of what you're all about. I write, I shoot, I strategize. I cause the buzz. I create the right kind of attention. The line between chaos and control is a thin one. And I'm a trapeze artist.  

My marketing philosophy: Brand Advocacy and Loyalty. Marketing smarter. The future of marketing isn't in advertising, it's in community. The sense of trust and loyalty that your customers and employees feel toward your brand is more valuable than any primetime ad spot. That's why I focus on creating and nurturing relationships with your existing customers through engaging and targeting creative ultimately building brand advocacy.
